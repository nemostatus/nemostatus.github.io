If you haven't read my last post i'm creating this dev log series to keep my habit of coding everyday for the next year, whether it be building a mini application, a bigger application or just to keep notes of my coding study sessions. So the past few days I've been solving coding puzzles on **codewars** and building mini applications. So it's been fun building mini apps and studying these algorithms but I'm starting to realize that I need to start switching focus on making larger applications that can help me transfer into the programming workforce. I have the idea of going back through my projects and adding more style and building out a portfolio application.  Then I can start thinking about building out larger applications that can help beef up this portfolio. It's exciting to think about what new projects I can create as my skills improve. Before I begin to handle my portfolio project I just wanted to share another mini app I created called secret message.

The application has no real world purpose but it is funny to see peoples expressions as they try it out.I would give a brief description of the application but it would ruin the fun of trying it out for the first time. Check out my github to try it out or just copy and paste the code into **JSFiddle**, just realized  I should make a JSFiddle account !

I did say in the last post that I want to provide some sort of value in these posts so here's a list of things I learned while building secret_message.

**What I learned**
1.Not to give up on ideas so fast, sometimes the idea may be right but the order is off
2.A for loop returns the last element in an array and isn't the only tool for wanting to do something with each element in an array
