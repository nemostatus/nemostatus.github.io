So I've finally decided to attempt the classic js project of building a calculator. I usually like using my current knowledge to attempt a project so that's exactly what I did. As expected I ran into some issues that I will troubleshoot this upcoming week. My thought process was to have an input field, the number buttons, operator buttons(+,-,x,/) and the enter button.
I thought, clicking a button should add to the current value of the input field. So clicking 1 would make the input field be 1 and clicking 2 next would give the user 12. It worked I was able to do this for all the numbers. However where I ran into issues was attempting to pass operators as parameters. I didn't know that it wasn't possible. So now I have to start researching the correct way of approaching this project. So stay tuned if you want to follow my attempt this week.
