   Hello there! Over the past two weeks after many error messages and energy drinks later I created a Pokemon CLI gem for my first Flatiron project. In this blog post I want to share a brief explanation of what my CLI gem can do, how my code works, what my personal process was, and finally what lessons I took away from this experience.
	 
   If you have the chance to interact with my CLI gem you will have access to a miniature pokedex. For the readers unfamiliar a pokedex is a device in the fictional world of Pokemon! Pokemon stands for pocket monster and the pokedex allows the user to choose a monster and after one is selected the user has the option to choose which attribute they would like to learn about that particular Pokemon. 
	 
  The architecture of my code consists of setting up everything needed: creating a git repo, bundle gem pokemon_cli, first commit, creating a executable file, and setting up the enviornment for the CLI gem. Then once everything was set up I created three classes: an API class in charge of bringing in external data(from PokeAPI) and instantiating new objects with the data, a Pokemon class in charge of storing data and gives my program the ability to create objects(with intitialize method and mass assignment) and finally a CLI class in charge of creating the experience with the user and gives the user options.
	
  This was definitely a huge learning experience for me. My first way of approaching my project wasn't working. I thought as long as I put in the time and worked hard that I could finish without a hitch. I was mistaken. I was creating my own loop of error messages and I knew that couldn't continue working the way I was. I knew in order to break this loop I had to change my approach so I slowed down a bit, took more breaks. Instead of focusing on the quantity of my thoughts I started focusing on the quality. I thought to myself, "just follow the data". So I took out a piece of paper and drew a diagram so it made more sense in my head of what was going on. Taking the theoretical and making it more understandable. I focused on how the data was pulled in, instantiated into objects, stored, manipulated and finally controlled with conditional statements. I do understand I have much more to learn however.
	
  Overall this experience has been a rollercoaster but after all the late nights and error messages  I finally broke the loop and finished my project. Thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy your day.
