Although it's been a couple of weeks since I last created a project I have been learning more about javascript, it's engine, and different data structures and algorithms. So far i've learned about stacks/queues, linked lists, binary trees and currently I'm learning about the creation phase(variables and objects or functions created and placed in memory) , execution phase, execution stack or call stack(learning about this data structure before hand helped me understand a bit more of the call stack), execution context, etc.

There's alot more to programming than I realized and it can be overwhelming. All the languages, frameworks,  etc.  For example the js engine coerces a data type to another data type in order to make it make sense. See the example below.

```
"1" == 1
true
"1" === 1
false

```

The above example shows that when using the double equal operator that the js engine will actually change the data type to make it make sense. In order to prevent that and any bugs as well you can use the strict equals operator. It's these kind of subtlties that can be a drop in the bucket of frustration and bugs. This comes from knowing one part of something but not all the parts that make up that part... That's where my current headspace is at. Ignore the frustration of error messages/ undesired results and take some time to really understand what's happening. Going forward I'm going to continue learning about debugging, subtlties, and taking more time to actually read my code and understand what is actually going on. 

This blog may seem all over the place but I just wanted to update my current progress, point out that there's always more to learn and that enjoying the process is just as important as solving the problem.
