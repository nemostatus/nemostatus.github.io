This blog is going to be shorter but it's something I wish I would've known while attending flatiron school last year. Just a short disclaimer that I'm not a professional and any changes you make to your home network should be discussed with your isp. Ok now with that out of the way I believe I have struck gold when it comes to improving my internet connection. This upcoming blog will mainly be for people surrounded by other routers (like apartments).

After watching a video called "How to make your WiFi and Internet speed faster with these 2 simple settings",
by a youtuber named Liron Segev I learned that  wifi signals are essentially radio waves. All routers are defaulted to a certain channel the isp provides. If you live in an apartment complex and everyone is on 1 specific channel then there will be alot of interference from other channels. In order to know what channel your wifi is on and also what the best channel is use a wifi analyzer app which will analyze if you're on the same channel as everyone else. There are some apps which will identify the best channel to connect to.

So as you change your routers channel always test your internet speed and compare to find the best channel. There are also apps that will identify the current wifi speed. So now knowing why other channels may be better, you only have to find out how to connect to the admin dashboard of your router in order to change the channel. I would contact your isp if you're not entirely sure how change any of your wifi settings and I'm sure they'll help out. 

So to recap.

1. Be mindful when changing any wifi settings and ask your isp if you can change your routers channel if you aren't comfortable
2. Download an app that will measure activity on all current wifi channels to see if you're currently conflicting with other signals
3. Measure your wifi speed using an app and compare your speed to find the best channel for you
4. In order to do this you need to know how to access your router admin dashboard which the info should be on the router itself somewhere or just contact your isp and ask
5. Once again check with your isp before making any changes and I am by no means a network professional and I don't claim any responsibility for whatever changes you make to your network 

Stay safe and happy coding everyone!
