Lately time has seem to be speeding up and more tasks are being added onto my day. Chores, work, studying, etc. So lately I've been looking into automation. I actually just bought an automatic cat feeder that automates that 1 job. So lately I've been imagining what other tasks could be automated to free up even more time in my day. Not just a simple task like feeding my cat. 

However, using a script to perform a series of actions seems like it's crossing some sort of internet line. Right? Well I'm not a lawyer so I cannot answer that but google probably can point you in the right direction. I know for sure that alot of sites don't allow scraping or automation, detailed in their particular terms and conditions. The only automation I've done so far is adding chrome to my startup folder so when my computer is turned on chrome launches. I also changed some chrome settings that automatically opens up codewars when it starts so essentially I don't have to click anything and I see a new code puzzle from codewars. This automation doesn't include any coding however it has shown the power of automation. I'm going to invest in a book called *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 2nd Edition:* by Al Sweigart. Maybe even purchase the course on udemy.

Here's a list from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ that explains what automation can do.

1.Search for text in a file or across multiple files
2.Create, update, move, and rename files and folders
3.Search the Web and download online content
4.Update and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any size
5.Split, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFs
6.Send reminder emails and text notifications
7.Fill out online forms

I'm excited to begin applying automation to save time, however I need to learn more about the legality of automation and how to wade through terms and conditions to find out the sites bot/scraper policies. I know that sites have a robots.txt file but I think that's more for search engine indexing. I've read  https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ is a good place to practice using selenium as it has alot of different input types. Like I said before, look at any sites terms and conditions before scraping or automating anything. You could even create your own forms and practice automation.
