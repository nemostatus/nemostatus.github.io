I find it exciting figuring out what my new found skill set can do. This last week I've been coding in Roblox Studio in a new language(Lua). So reading through the roblox developer docs I built a roblox obstacle course game. Roblox studio offers a very powerful building environment.  It has it's own console,  a window to see all of the objects in the game and another window to see all of the properties of those objects. 

I felt in my element building this obstacle course because alot of programming concepts I've learned so far are relevant to developing in Roblox Studio. These core concepts are 

1. Event Listeners
2. Event handlers
3. Conditional statements
4. Functions
5. Objects and changing the properties of the objects
6. Testing output using console.log() (in Lua it's print())

Although I do have alot to learn, here's what I learned so far.
1.   How to add scripts.
2.    How to display text screen to user. 
3.   How to use event handlers and listeners to manipulate data of the objects in the game.
4.   How to troubleshoot using print() and referring to the developer documentation
5.   Add objects in the game and change it's properties

My favorite part of my obstacle course is the final obstacle which is a boulder trap like in* Indiana Jones*. How this was done was to add a script. In the script I added a 'touch' event on the ground. So when the player lands on the ground an event handler is triggered. This handler changes the property of another object  in the game. This object is a wall holding a boulder back. Changing the canCollide property of the wall to false makes it so that the boulder is no longer colliding against the wall and then rolls down a ramp in the players direction. 

This was a fun week of coding and goes to show that even though a language is different doesn't mean that you can't code in it and knowing the fundamentals can carry you a long way in building any programming project. Happy coding everyone!
