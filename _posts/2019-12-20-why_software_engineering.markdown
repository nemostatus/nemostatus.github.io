 #### In my adult life I ran into paralysis by analysis when it came to career options. So I took some time to myself to thoroughly research my options and one day it clicked. I discovered that software engineering checked off all the boxes required to bring fulfillment to my life. It benefits society, offers financial stability for my family and will give me a sense of freedom.
	
####   I understand in order to help society I have to first realize that technology is what is driving it forward. I have a starting point.  For now my main focus is to just learn as much as I can so that I can work on the problems of the world. I could either discover a way to build new software which solves a problem or work for companies that make the world run more efficiently while making a liveable wage doing it.
				
#### I love my family and I want to give them all I can. So seeing that employment of software developers is projected to grow 21 percent from 2018 to 2028 with the 2018 median pay being $105,590 per year according to bls.gov gave me another reason to  pursue this interesting career.  
		
#### with all dreams I realize that I have to also focus on the reality of the situation so I did test the waters before hand, studying and watching anything related to code  I enjoy both the logical side of coding since it is controlled and you know what to expect once you get a concept down. On the other hand I have seen people use their creative side to build very interesting projects with code. I can say that I am excited to continue learning as much as I can with my cohort and pursue a career as a software engineer.
