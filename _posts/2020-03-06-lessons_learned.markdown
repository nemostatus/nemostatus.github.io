 I typically write out a rough draft for my blogs but this time I'm just going to type from the heart and talk about some lessons that I've learned from the past few months about this program and life. I knew learning how to program would be challenging but there have been a few curveballs that I want to go over so that if a new student ever reads this blog, they can hopefully take some useful information with them. 
  
	So the first curveball I want to discuss is that not every learning strategy is the same and sometimes you have to find what works for you. My first strategy was to not only read the lessons but write down in a notebook almost every point in it. Although it seemed like it was working but it took way too long and was very tedious. So I began to write down the concepts that I struggled with instead. This not only worked but was a huge time saver. The next strategy that helped me grasp the concepts easier was to use REPL which is great tool to help put practice the concepts being taught. Although REPL is good for practice I was still struggling with certain labs. So the last big game changing learning tool I have been implementing was PRY. If you're just starting to learn how to code do not put off learning how to use pry. I know it's only briefly gone over but it is very important in figuring out exactly what is going on while coding if you're lost.
	
	The next curveball that I'm still adjusting to is time management and work/school balance. I'm still figuring out  learning how to code can be time consuming and stressful. I'm still getting used to adjusting my schedule around learning. What has been working for me is adjusting my schedule and prioritizing what is most important first. For instance at first I would come home from working my shift at Amazon and be exhausted so instead of resting I would try to complete labs because I wanted to make progress but ironically I was just hurting myself. I was taking 2 steps back to take a step forward. I wasn't getting very far in labs and would just be irritable. So I adjusted and just unwinded from my shift then sleep, wake up and be refreshed and ready to tackle the labs for that day. I know it sounds like common sense(which it is) but it's so easy to forget when you're behind on lessons and want to accomplish as much as possible. 
	
	So the last and most important lesson that I've learned and I need to remind myself is that failure is part of the process. Seeing an error message after trying everything means that you need to stop, learn more, go on AAQ, and then return to the lab. I have repeatedly wasted hours seeing error message after error message. I  had a  BAD HABIT of just throwing an educated guess in and saying, "that should work." I now think to myself, "I don't have a full grasp of the concept just yet. I need to do a review of the parts I don't fully understand and come back to the lab. If that still doesn't work I need extra help from AAQ."
	
	In conclusion I've learned that it's important to have a learning strategy that works for me, adjust learning into my schedule where I feel the best and refreshed and most importantly that failure is part of the process and asking for help is vital sometimes.
