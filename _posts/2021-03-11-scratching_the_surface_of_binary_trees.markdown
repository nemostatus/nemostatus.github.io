Hello! So this past week i've been trying to learn binary trees. Here's what I've learned so far.

1. There's a root node of a binary tree
2. The left node of another node has a lesser value of the parent node
3. The right node of another node has a greater value of the parent node

Here's the resource I used to scratch the surface of the rules and code of binary search trees . [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/](http://)
